## Aim

* Basic communication theory and its relevancy with communicating with data
* Demonstrate communication competency by selecting appropriate behaviour based on audience and self monitoring
* Identify and apply rhetorical elements to improve data storytelling 
* Clearly articulate and express technical problems for others to help you

:::

::: {.callout-tip }

## Why

* Effective communication with data is a blend of hard and soft skills 
* You need the hard skills to process and understand the data 
* But you also need the soft skills to get the message across to others

:::


## Communicating


::: {.blockquote}
To effectively communicate, we must realize that we are all different in the way we perceive the world and use this understanding as a guide to our communication with others.

[-- Anthony Robbins]{.fr}

:::


## Communicating [with data]{.monash-blue}

::: {.blockquote}
The two words 'information' and 'communication' are often used interchangeably, but they signify quite different things. Information is giving out; **communication is getting through**.

[-- Sydney J. Harris]{.fr}
:::


# The Basics of <br>[Communication Theory]{.monash-blue}

::: callout-warning

## Communication here refers to human communication

In this section, communication refers to **_human_** communication. 
:::


## Communication is [symbolic]{.monash-blue}


::: incremental

- Arbitrary nature of symbols is overcome with linguistic rules
- Agreement among people about these rules is required to effectively communicate
- **Meanings rest in people, not words**

:::

## Communication is a [process]{.monash-blue}

Communication is often thought of as discrete, independent acts but in fact it is a continuous, ongoing process.

:::


## Communication [competence]{.monash-blue}

::: incremental 

* **There is no single, ideal way to communicate**
* Competence is situational and relational (where, what and who)
* Ability to **select the most appropriate behaviour** in a particular situation 
* Skill to **perform behaviour** not just knowing them
* **Empathy** or perspective taking 
* **Cognitive complexity** -- ability to construct a variety of framework for viewing an issue
* **Self-monitoring** -- paying close to your own behaviour and use this to shape your behaviour

:::



## [Types]{.monash-blue} of communication

-   **Intrapersonal** [-- communicating with one-self]{.fragment}
-   **Dyadic/interpersonal** [-- two people interacting]{.fragment}
-   **Small group** [-- two or more people interacting with group membership]{.fragment}
-   **Public** [-- a group too large for all to contribute]{.fragment}
-   **Mass** [-- messages transmitted to large, wide-spread audiences via media]{.fragment}

::: fragment

::: callout-note

## Tutorial

How does your communication strategy change for different types of communication?

:::

:::

## [Effective]{.monash-blue} communication 

::: incremental 

* Communication doesn't always require complete understanding 
* We notice some messages more and ignore others, e.g. we tend to notice messages that are:
   * **intense**, 
   * **repetitious**, and 
   * **constrastive**.
* **Motives** also determine what information we select from environment

:::


::: notes 

* We are influenced by what is most obvious

# Rhetorics

The art of effective or persuasive speaking or writing

## Rhetorical Triangle

<center>
<img src="images/drawn/rhetorical-triangle.png">
</center>

::: notes

Ethos - Writer. Make it clear why people listen to you
Pathos - Audience. Appeal to the audience to listen to you. Engage them.
Logos - Context. Audience will put things in context for them. Make sure it will make sense. (Example)

# Communicating *your problem*

::: incremental 

* Asking for help, requires you to communicate what your problem is to another party.  

* How you communicate your problem, can assist you greatly in getting the answer to your problem.

::: {.ba .pa3}

I am looking to adjust the size of two separate ggplots within the same R chunk in Rmarkdown. These plots must be different when outputted as a pdf, so defining the dimensions at the beginning of the chunk doesn't work. Does anyone have any ideas? My code is below.
````md
`r ''````{r, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 3}
ggplot(df, aes(weight, height)) +
  geom_point()

ggplot(df, aes(height, volume)) +

* Once you run the above command, your clipboard contains the formatted code and output for you to paste into places like [GitHub issues](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.15/user/articles/creating-an-issue), [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and forums powered by [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/), e.g. [RStudio Community](https://community.rstudio.com/).
* For general code questions, I suggest that you post to the community forums rather than Moodle.

## Week 1 Lesson  {.scrollable}


::: callout-important

## Summary

* Communication is a symbolic, ongoing process that requires **_getting through_** to other parties
* There is no single ideal way to communicate -- communication competence depends on situation and relations but a competent communicator can select and perform appropriate behaviour based on **seeing other people's perspectives** and **understanding their own behaviour**
* We discussed about the **elements of rhetorics** and how it relates to telling a compelling data story
* We looked at the case study with communicating your problem to ask for help
