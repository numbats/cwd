## 🏁 Expectations [Part 2]{.f4}


[<i class="fas fa-running"></i> Be an active learner!]{.f1}

::: blockquote 

An **active learner** asks questions, considers alternatives, questions assumptions, and even questions the trustworthiness of the author or speaker. An active learner tries to generalize specific examples, and devise specific examples for generalities.

An active learner doesn’t passively sponge up information — that doesn’t work! — but **uses the readings and lecturer’s argument as a springboard for critical thought and deep understanding**.
