## üèÅ Expectations [Part 2]{.f4}


[<i class="fas fa-running"></i> Be an active learner!]{.f1}

::: blockquote 

An **active learner** asks questions, considers alternatives, questions assumptions, and even questions the trustworthiness of the author or speaker. An active learner tries to generalize specific examples, and devise specific examples for generalities.

An active learner doesn‚Äôt passively sponge up information ‚Äî that doesn‚Äôt work! ‚Äî but **uses the readings and lecturer‚Äôs argument as a springboard for critical thought and deep understanding**.

# Communication time


## {#aim}

::: {.callout-important }

## Aim

* Basic communication theory and its relevancy with communicating with data
* Demonstrate communication competency by selecting appropriate behaviour based on audience and self monitoring
* Identify and apply rhetorical elements to improve data storytelling 
* Clearly articulate and express technical problems for others to help you

:::

::: {.callout-tip }

## Why

* Effective communication with data is a blend of hard and soft skills 
* You need the hard skills to process and understand the data 
* But you also need the soft skills to get the message across to others

:::


## Communicating


::: {.blockquote}
To effectively communicate, we must realize that we are all different in the way we perceive the world and use this understanding as a guide to our communication with others.

[-- Anthony Robbins]{.fr}

:::

# Communication is a skill

If you practice, it will get better.

## Why should you listen to me though?

I've had a lot of practice.

::: {.fragment}
To scientists:

* Dozens of presentations at conferences and seminars, 
* Broad collaborations in a wide range of fields
:::

::: {.fragment}
To less technical audiences:

* Hundreds of media interviews,
* Probably a hundred ministerial briefings,
* Many more high level meetings with government and industry stakeholders
:::

## Why should you listen to me though?

Communication has got me a lot of where I am now.

::: {.fragment .blockquote}

A good economist isn't right all the time, but they are very good at explaining when they are wrong

:::

#### If you can do technical work _and_ tell people about it, you will be in high demand {.center}

## Communicating [with data]{.monash-blue}

::: {.blockquote}
The two words 'information' and 'communication' are often used interchangeably, but they signify quite different things. Information is giving out; **communication is getting through**.

[-- Sydney J. Harris]{.fr}
:::


# The Basics of <br>[Communication Theory]{.monash-blue}

::: callout-warning

## Communication here refers to human communication

In this section, communication refers to **_human_** communication. 
:::


## Communication is [symbolic]{.monash-blue}


::: incremental

- Arbitrary nature of symbols is overcome with linguistic rules
- Agreement among people about these rules is required to effectively communicate
- **Meanings rest in people, not words**

:::

<center>
<img src="images/triangle-of-meaning.png" height="300px">
</center>

## Communication is a [process]{.monash-blue}

Communication is often thought of as discrete, independent acts but in fact it is a continuous, ongoing process.

::: {.column width='50%'}

**Transactional communication**

![](images/transactional-communication-model.png){fig-align="center"}

:::
:::

## Communication [competence]{.monash-blue}

::: incremental 

* **There is no single, ideal way to communicate**
* Competence is situational and relational (where, what and who)
* Ability to **select the most appropriate behaviour** in a particular situation 
* Skill to **perform behaviour** not just knowing them
* **Empathy** or perspective taking 
* **Cognitive complexity** -- ability to construct a variety of framework for viewing an issue
* **Self-monitoring** -- paying close to your own behaviour and use this to shape your behaviour

:::



## [Types]{.monash-blue} of communication

-   **Intrapersonal** [-- communicating with one-self]{.fragment}
-   **Dyadic/interpersonal** [-- two people interacting]{.fragment}
-   **Small group** [-- two or more people interacting with group membership]{.fragment}
-   **Public** [-- a group too large for all to contribute]{.fragment}
-   **Mass** [-- messages transmitted to large, wide-spread audiences via media]{.fragment}

::: fragment

::: callout-note

## Tutorial

How does your communication strategy change for different types of communication?

:::

:::

## [Effective]{.monash-blue} communication 

::: incremental 

* Communication doesn't always require complete understanding 
* We notice some messages more and ignore others, e.g. we tend to notice messages that are:
   * **intense**, 
   * **repetitious**, and 
   * **constrastive**.
* **Motives** also determine what information we select from environment

:::


::: notes 

* We are influenced by what is most obvious

# Rhetorics

The art of effective or persuasive speaking or writing

## Rhetorical Triangle

::: notes

Ethos - Writer. Make it clear why people listen to you
Pathos - Audience. Appeal to the audience to listen to you. Engage them.
Logos - Context. Audience will put things in context for them. Make sure it will make sense. (Example)

* Asking for help, requires you to communicate what your problem is to another party.

## Week 1 Lesson  {.scrollable}


::: callout-important

## Summary

* Communication is a symbolic, ongoing process that requires **_getting through_** to other parties
* There is no single ideal way to communicate -- communication competence depends on situation and relations but a competent communicator can select and perform appropriate behaviour based on **seeing other people's perspectives** and **understanding their own behaviour**
* We discussed about the **elements of rhetorics** and how it relates to telling a compelling data story
* We looked at the case study with communicating your problem to ask for help
