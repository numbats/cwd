## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives


* dissect the encoding choices for plots and its role in providing the information that supports your data story
* discuss with peers about effective data visualisation



## Exercise 11A

For the following data visualisation, discuss with your peers:

- What are the main information that the audiences will gain? 
- What makes the data visualisation effective or not effective?
- What other graphs would you construct for the same intended message?

In particular, you should check the following:

- **Perceptual tasks**: What visual element must the audience decode to retrieve the statistical information?
- **Cognitive principles**: What cognitive principles are assisting the audience to "see" the information you want them to see?
- **Aesthetic appeal**: How well is the aesthetic design integrated with the rest of the data story?
