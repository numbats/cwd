## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives


* practice writing long-form documentation vignettes
* write functions and its documentation using `usethis` and `roxygen2`
* convert your package documentation into a website with `pkgdown`

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}

## Preparation

1. `install.packages(c("pkgdown"))`
2. Clone the github repo below:

```{zsh}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
git clone git@github.com:MikeLydeamore/solardash.git
```

:::



##  Exercise 9A

Open the `solardash` project directory and create a new vignette via `usethis`.

The name of the vignette should be "crops" and the title will be 
"Our World in Data: Key Crop Yields".

Your vignette should contain the following:

- A description of the data, including it's source, and how to access it with your package.
- Two `ggplot2` visualisations with short descriptions, giving examples of things you could learn from the `smartmeter` data. Remember that any external packages you use should be added to your DESCRIPTION file under Suggests.

Once you have finished your vignette, create a README file via `usethis`
that describes the intent of the package and how you could install it from your
github.

##  Exercise 9B

Build a local `pkgdown` website. 
Modify the `pkgdown` YAML file so your website has the following:

- a customised theme for the website
- the vignette is available via  "Articles" link in the navbar

## Exercise 9C

Inspect the `inst` directory. What do you see in there?

How is that code being used in the package?

Write a _new_ shiny app, based on the one in `inst`, that converts the current ggplot to a `plotly` output. Then, write a new function for the package that will run this app.
